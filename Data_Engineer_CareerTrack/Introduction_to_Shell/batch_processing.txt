# Shell Scipting

1. $@ (dollar sign immediately followed by at-sign) to mean 
"all of the command-line parameters given to the script".

2. How can I process a single argument?
As well as $@, the shell lets you use $1, $2, and so on to refer to specific command-line parameters. 
You can use this to write commands that feel simpler or more natural than the shell's.

3. How can I write loops in a shell script?
# Print the first and last data records of each file.
for filename in $@
do
    head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
    tail -n 1 $filename
done
